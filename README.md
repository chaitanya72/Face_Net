# Face_Net
This is an notebook showing the implementation of Face Identification using the topics described in Face Net

I have used a pre-trained model to implement  Face Identification. This program encodes the people's face into a 128 bit encoding and compares the distances between the actual encoding and the new image to tell wether the person is the same person or not.
